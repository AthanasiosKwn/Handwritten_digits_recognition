This project deals with the classic problem of handwritten digits recognition. The famous MNIST dataset is leveraged to train, test and compare two different
image classification networks. The significance of the evaluation phase during model training and the necessity of having a sufficient number of images are discussed.
The superiority of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image processing is validated through evidence.

This repository contains two '.py' files (one for each type network) and a '.pdf' file of the detailed project report.

Language used : Python
Modules used : PyTorch , sklearn, Matplotlib
